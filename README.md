Breakout Styled Game - HighSchool Project

This is a game I made in highschool.  I used it to enter into the University of Toronto Showcase competition, and it got me into the finals!.  It's a pretty simple breakout style game, but has some cool added upgrades + I voiced all the sound effects! (That last feature is kind of embarassing).  A friend and I also made the background techno riff.   

I've tested it on ubuntu 14.04 with python 2.7.X and it still works.

To play:

- install python and pygame
- run 'python Pybreaker.py'
- enjoy
